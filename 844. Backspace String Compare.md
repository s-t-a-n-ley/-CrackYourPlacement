Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".

Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

**Solution**
```
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def build_stack(string):
            stack=[]
            for char in string:
                if char == '#':
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(char)
            return stack
        return build_stack(s)== build_stack(t)
```
