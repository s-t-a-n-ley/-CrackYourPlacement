Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.


Example 1:

Input: heigh
ts = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

**Solution**
```
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        min_area = 0 
        index = 0

        while index < len(heights):
            if not stack or heights[index] >= heights[stack[-1]]:
                stack.append(index)
                index += 1
            else:
                top_stack = stack.pop()
                area = heights[top_stack] * ((index-stack[-1] - 1)if stack else index)
                max_area = max(max_area, area)

        while stack:
            top_stack = stack.pop()
            area = heights[top_stack] * ((index - stack[-1] - 1)if stack else index)
            max_area = max(max_area, area)

        return max_area
```
