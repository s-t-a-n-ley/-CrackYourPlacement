Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true

**Solution**
```
class Solution:
  def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
  
    if not board or not board[0]:
        return False
    
    rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])
    
    def backtrack(r, c, index):
        # Base case: all characters are matched
        if index == len(word):
            return True
        
        # Boundary conditions
        if r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or board[r][c] != word[index]:
            return False
        
        # Mark the cell as visited by temporarily changing its value
        temp = board[r][c]
        board[r][c] = '#'
        
        # Explore all adjacent cells
        found = (
            backtrack(r + 1, c, index + 1) or
            backtrack(r - 1, c, index + 1) or
            backtrack(r, c + 1, index + 1) or
            backtrack(r, c - 1, index + 1)
        )
        
        # Unmark the cell (backtracking)
        board[r][c] = temp
        
        return found
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if backtrack(i, j, 0):
                return True
    
    return False

      
```
